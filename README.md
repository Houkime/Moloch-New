*In any system optimizing for X, the opportunity arises to throw any value under the bus for optimized X.*

Moloch is the roguelike of all the horrible futures. Instead of health points, the player's human (or otherwise applicable) conditions are (somewhat) simulated to make for a fleshly experience. Fell from too high? I sure hope you don't need those knees.

You are a child who was sacrificed by your parents to the god at the top of The Ancient Tower. The tradeoff is simple: Throw away what you love most, and I can give you power. You refuse to let yourself be murdered by the people and the creatures inhabiting the tower, and in a desperate attempt to survive, you begin your ascent.

## Features
### A fleshly health system
Instead of health points, Moloch's health system is based on different kinds of conditions, some of which might not even kill you, but can make the game impossible to play. The clearest example is fall damage: In Moloch, when you fall from dangerous heights, you can lose your legs, rendering you unable to walk or jump for the rest of the run, and depending on how the run was going, this might mean you have to restart.

This is done for every entity, not only the player.
 
### Custom wands
Moloch allows you to collect spells, letting you move them from wands and create your ultimate weapon of mass destruction. Careful, though! Migth get a heat stroke!

### Destructible levels
Mostly everything can be destroyed if you have the right spells for it. Mostly.
